## MDC-R Corpus

To open, please use MMAX2 

We have created a custom version of MMAX2 that displays enlarged images to better suit our use case: 
https://arciduca.org/minecraft-mmax.tgz

However, the original MMAX2 will also work https://mmax2.net/.

The corpus is in the corpus folder

A separate folder, objects, allows users to lookup world states, block colours and coordinates by the alphanumerical label used in the MMAX corpus.  The JSON formatted files share filenames with their image counterparts.
